Where do we use malloc
For dynamic memory allocation we use it, like we use it in linked list
 
Diff between calloc & malloc 
Malloc allocates only the requested memory block of memory. Calloc allocates memory according to the specified number of blocks of memory of a specific type

| Feature                    | malloc()                                      | calloc()                                         |
+----------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| Function                   | Allocates memory                              | Allocates and also initializes memory            |
| Initialization             | Does NOT initialize (contains garbage values) | Initializes all bytes to zero                    |
| Syntax                     | malloc(size)                                  | calloc(num, size)                                |
| Parameters                 | Single argument (total bytes)                 | Two arguments (num of blocks, size per block)    |
| Return Type                | void *                                        | void *                                           |
| Example                    | int *p = (int *)malloc(5 * sizeof(int));      | int *p = (int *)calloc(5, sizeof(int));          |
| Speed                      | Faster (no initialization)                    | Slower (due to zero initialization)              |
| Memory Allocation Type     | Contiguous block                              | Contiguous block                                 |
| Header File Required       | #include <stdlib.h>                           | #include <stdlib.h>                              |

Which one is faster
malloc() is faster than calloc()

malloc() simply allocates memory without initializing it.

calloc() allocates and initializes all allocated bytes to zero, which takes extra time.
